===============================
2026 AGENT-FIRST TODO TEMPLATE
===============================

Feature Name:
<short, descriptive name>

--------------------------------
0. STATUS & SCOPE
--------------------------------
Status:
PLANNING | IN PROGRESS | BLOCKED

Priority:
LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH | CRITICAL

Target Phase / Release:
<if applicable>

Out of Scope (explicit):
- <things this feature will NOT address>


--------------------------------
1. PROBLEM STATEMENT (WHY)
--------------------------------
Describe the problem, not the solution.

- What user or system problem does this solve?
- What is broken, missing, inefficient, or limiting today?
- What happens if we do not build this?

Avoid implementation details.


--------------------------------
2. SUCCESS CRITERIA (DEFINITION OF DONE)
--------------------------------
This feature is successful if:

- [ ] Observable user or system behavior X
- [ ] Performance, correctness, or reliability constraint Y
- [ ] Backward compatibility guarantee Z
- [ ] No regressions in critical areas

These must be verifiable.


--------------------------------
3. CORE INVARIANTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
--------------------------------
The following must never be violated:

- <Single source of truth for X>
- <Canonical representations or formats>
- <Security, correctness, or data integrity rules>

Any solution that violates an invariant is incorrect.


--------------------------------
4. CONSTRAINTS & ASSUMPTIONS
--------------------------------

Technical Constraints:
- <DB schema assumptions>
- <Latency / runtime limits>
- <Deployment or infrastructure constraints>

Product Constraints:
- <UX, localization, accessibility requirements>

Organizational Constraints:
- <Team boundaries, ownership, release constraints>

Assumptions (explicit and challengeable):
- <Assumption 1>
- <Assumption 2>


--------------------------------
5. ARCHITECTURAL APPROACH (HIGH LEVEL)
--------------------------------
Describe the shape of the solution.

- Where does this logic live (domain, service, boundary)?
- What is the source of truth?
- What responsibilities are explicitly excluded?

No file paths.
No method signatures.


--------------------------------
6. DECISION POINTS (AGENT MUST REASON)
--------------------------------
The agent must evaluate and justify decisions.

Decision A:
- Option 1: <description>
- Option 2: <description>
Tradeoff to evaluate:
- <e.g. correctness vs performance>

Decision B:
- <...>


--------------------------------
7. EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES
--------------------------------
Required prerequisites:
- <Phase / system> — <reason>

Optional or future integrations:
- <Context only, not required now>


--------------------------------
8. FAILURE MODES & EDGE CASES
--------------------------------
What could go wrong?

- Invalid or partial data
- Unknown inputs or formats
- Migration or rollback scenarios
- Partial system availability


--------------------------------
9. TESTING EXPECTATIONS (INTENT)
--------------------------------
Describe what must be proven correct.

- Which invariants must tests enforce?
- Which edge cases require explicit coverage?
- What failure modes must be validated?

Do not list individual test names.


--------------------------------
10. EXPLICIT NON-GOALS
--------------------------------
To prevent scope creep, this feature does NOT address:

- <Non-goal 1>
- <Non-goal 2>


--------------------------------
11. OPEN QUESTIONS
--------------------------------
Unresolved issues that affect design or scope:

- <Question 1>
- <Question 2>


--------------------------------
12. AGENT INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------
Mandatory instructions:

- Use Context7 for framework and library best practices.
- Surface conflicts between Context7 guidance and project rules.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Do not invent requirements not listed above.

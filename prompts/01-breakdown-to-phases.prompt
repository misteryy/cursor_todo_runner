You are given a high-level Design/MVP document @DesignDocument

Your task:
- Break down this design into focused Feature Overviews (one per phase).
- Each Feature Overview must use the provided @templates/01-feature-overview.template
- Each phase should represent a coherent milestone with clear deliverables.
- Preserve all core constraints and requirements from the design.
- Surface risks and unknowns explicitly in each overview.
- Assume Context7 will be used for framework and library details.
- If any open questions block the breakdown, list them and stop — let's resolve together.
  Give at least 3 suggestions with short explanations for each question.

Output:
- One Feature Overview per phase (typically 3–8 phases for a full project)
- Each overview standalone and usable for TODO generation
- Store each overview in docs/design/active/
- Filename pattern: {number:2d}_Phase{N}_{Short_Name}.md
  Examples: 01_Phase1_Foundation_And_Design_System.md, 02_Phase2_Map_Integration.md

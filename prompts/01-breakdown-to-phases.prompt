You are given a high-level Design/MVP document @DesignDocument

Your task:
- Break down this design into focused Feature Overviews (one per phase).
- Each Feature Overview must use the provided @templates/01-feature-overview.template
- Each phase should represent a coherent milestone with clear deliverables.
- Preserve all core constraints and requirements from the design.
- Surface risks and unknowns explicitly in each overview.
- Assume Context7 will be used for framework and library details.
- If any open questions block the breakdown, list them and stop — let's resolve together.
  Give at least 3 suggestions with short explanations for each question.

Output:
- One Feature Overview per phase (typically 3–8 phases for a full project)
- Each overview standalone and usable for TODO generation
- Store each overview in docs/phase/active/
- Filename pattern: P{version}_{Type}_{Short_Name}.md
  - version: integer or dotted version (e.g. 01, 02.5, 03.1.2) for sub-phases or insertions
  - Type: phase | feature | bugfix | chore | spike | refactor (lowercase)
  - Short_Name: concise slug (e.g. Foundation_And_Design_System)
- File numbers must reflect intended implementation order (P01 before P02, P02.5 between P02 and P03, etc.)
  Examples: P01_feature_Foundation.md, P02_feature_Map.md, P02.5_feature_Map_Overlay.md, P03_bugfix_Login.md

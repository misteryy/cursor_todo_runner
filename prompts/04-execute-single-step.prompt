We are executing this step file: @StepFile

Implement only what this step describes. Do not anticipate or implement future steps.

Rules:
- Do not refactor or change code outside the scope of this step.
- After implementing, run the "How to verify" section for this step (commands, tests, or checks). Run the specified tests and report pass/fail.
- If the step modifies code that has existing tests, run those tests even if not explicitly listed in "How to verify".
- If the step modifies UI code and no tests exist for it, add component/widget tests as part of this step and run them.
- Stop when this step is complete and verified.
- End with a minimal summary: (1) what changed, (2) verification result, (3) manual tests if applicable. Do not create or edit files in docs/TODO/summaries/ — the runner generates one summary per phase at the end of the run.
- Do not move or rename the step file or any file in docs/TODO/active/steps/ or docs/TODO/completed/steps/ — the runner marks the step complete after you finish.
- Do not move the Agent-First TODO file — the runner handles that when all steps are complete.

On successful completion:
- The runner will move this step file to completed automatically. You do nothing in docs/TODO for success.

When verification does NOT pass (e.g. command fails, environment missing, tests fail):
- Create exactly one markdown file in docs/TODO/action_required/ describing what failed and what the user must do to fix it. Use a clear filename, e.g. take_action_P1_01.01_environment_verification.md. The runner will not run further steps until this file is resolved.
- At the end of the take_action file, include a "Resolution" section with: `## Resolution\n\nWhen this issue is resolved, rename this file from \`take_action_*\` to \`resolved_*\` (e.g., \`take_action_P1_01.01_issue.md\` → \`resolved_P1_01.01_issue.md\`). The runner will then continue with the next step.`

When you encounter an existing take_action_* file in docs/TODO/action_required/:
- This file describes an issue that needs to be resolved by the AI agent (you).
- Read the file, understand the problem, and implement the fix.
- After successfully resolving the issue (implementing the fix and verifying it works), rename the file from take_action_* to resolved_* (e.g., take_action_P1_01.01_issue.md becomes resolved_P1_01.01_issue.md).
- The runner will then process the resolved file and continue with the next step.

Do not commit to git.

You are generating an execution summary for work completed during a TODO runner session.

## Input Context

- **TODO file**: @TodoFile
- **Completed steps this session**: @CompletedSteps
- **Pending steps (not yet done)**: @PendingSteps
- **Blocker (if any)**: @ActionRequired
- **Run outcome**: @Outcome (SUCCESS | PARTIAL | BLOCKED)

## Summary Requirements

Write a comprehensive execution summary covering the sections below. Adapt depth to the amount of work done — a single step needs less detail than a full TODO.

### 1. Overview
- What TODO/feature was being implemented (1-2 sentences)
- Final status: fully complete, partially complete, or blocked
- Steps completed vs total (e.g., "3 of 5 steps completed")

### 2. What Was Implemented
For each completed step:
- Brief description of what was built or changed
- Key files created or modified
- Notable implementation decisions or patterns used

### 3. Technical Details
- Dependencies added or configured (if any)
- Architecture patterns or conventions followed
- Tests written and what they cover (if any)

### 4. Verification Results
- What verification commands were run for each step
- Outcomes (pass/fail)
- Any warnings or notes worth preserving

### 5. Current State
If not fully complete:
- What remains to be done (list pending steps with brief descriptions)
- Current blockers (if any)
- Specific actions needed to continue

### 6. Blockers and Resolution (only if BLOCKED)
- Exact error or failure that caused the block
- Root cause analysis (if determinable)
- Recommended resolution path(s)
- Environment or dependency notes

## Output Guidelines

- Write as markdown
- Be thorough but concise — completeness without redundancy
- Include code snippets or command output only when they clarify important points
- Use bullet points for lists; paragraphs for narrative sections
- Target length: proportional to work done (1 step ≈ 1 page; full TODO ≈ 2-4 pages)

## Output Location

Save the summary to the path provided. Do not create additional files.
If the file already exists, overwrite it with the updated state.

Do not commit to git.

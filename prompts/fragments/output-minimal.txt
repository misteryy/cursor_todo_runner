Output (runner is unattended; minimize tokens and time — do not stream long replies):
- Emit only the minimum: (1) one-line summary of what changed, (2) verification pass/fail, (3) manual tests if applicable (e.g., "Manual: run app, tap X, verify Y"). No step-by-step narration, no explanations, no preambles or postambles.
- Prefer doing over saying: use tools; do not output progress or reasoning unless it is essential.
- Keep your final message to a few sentences at most. Lengthy output wastes time and tokens.

Manual testing:
- If this step requires manual testing (UI verification, user interaction, behavior that cannot be automated), create a file in docs/TODO/action_required/ with clear instructions for what the user should test.
- Use a filename like manual_test_<stepId>.md (e.g., manual_test_P1_03.1.md).
- Include: what to run, what to check, expected behavior, and how to confirm success.
- The runner will pause until this file is removed after the user completes manual testing.
- Only create this file when manual testing is truly necessary (meaningful UI/UX verification, not just "it compiles").

- For EACH task in the step file: print one line stating which task you are starting (e.g. "- Using Context7 for geolocator permission handling", "- Add locate button to map_controls.dart").
- Between task announcements: no text output — only use tools.
- AFTER all tasks complete: summary with (1) what changed, (2) verification pass/fail, (3) manual tests if applicable (e.g., "Manual: run app, tap locate button, verify map centers on current location").

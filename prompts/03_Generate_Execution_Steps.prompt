Decompose this TODO @AgentFirstTODO into ordered execution steps suitable for step-by-step implementation with manual testing between steps.

Output:
- One markdown file per step under docs/TODO/active/steps/
- Filename pattern: {TODO_NUMBER}.{N:2d}_{short_slug}.md
  Example: 15.1_TODO_Amount_Qualifier_Detection.md --> 15.1.1_patterns_module.md, 15.1.2_tests.md
- Each step file must contain:
  1. Step number and title
  2. Goal (what this step achieves)
  3. Depends on: (step number or "none")
  4. Concrete tasks (bullet list)
  5. "How to verify" (commands or checks to run; must be runnable; run linter checks only for affected files)
  6. Estimated duration (target ~1 hour or less per step)

Rules:
- Each step must be independently testable.
- Tests must mock or explicitly close any I/O used by the code under test (Redis, DB, BullMQ, HTTP servers, timers) so Jest exits with no open handles.
- If the TODO involves database changes, never include a step that requests a full DB reset; use additive migrations only.
- Do NOT write any code yet.
- Do NOT repeat the full design from the TODO; reference it by section (e.g. "per §5 Architectural Approach").
- Last step file must include: "After this step is verified, move the Agent-First TODO file from docs/TODO/active/ to docs/TODO/completed/ (use mv, same filename)."
- If there are open questions that block decomposition, list them and stop; do not create step files until resolved.
- Do not commit to git.

Create only the step files. No summary document unless the TODO explicitly asks for one.

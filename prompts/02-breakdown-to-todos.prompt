You are given a high-level feature overview @HighLevelTemplate

Your task:
- Decompose this overview into multiple focused TODOs.
- Each TODO must use the provided @02-agent-first-todo.template
- Each TODO should solve one coherent problem.
- Do NOT repeat the entire overview in each TODO.
- Preserve all core invariants and constraints from the overview.
- Surface design decisions and tradeoffs explicitly.
- Assume Context7 will be used for framework and library details.
- If any open questions do not create document yet and let's resolve together. Give at least 3 of your suggestions with short explanation why, for each of the questions.

Starting Point:
- If the overview already includes suggested Agent-First TODOs, use them as a starting point.
- Refine, split, merge, or reorder as needed—do not blindly copy.
- Add missing TODOs if the suggestions are incomplete.

GUI vs Backend Classification:
- Mark each TODO as primarily GUI, Backend, or Mixed in the Status & Scope section.
- GUI TODOs (widgets, layouts, screens, animations) will generate steps that benefit from capable visual-reasoning models.
- Backend TODOs (services, data, logic) decompose atomically into smaller steps.
- Mixed TODOs should be split if possible—GUI and backend logic are easier to verify separately.
- This classification flows into step generation, where:
  - Simple GUI steps are auto-detected from paths (`lib/**/presentation/**`, `lib/**/widgets/**`)
  - Compound GUI steps (3+ widgets working together) use `_GUI_` filename prefix
  - Backend steps decompose normally

Before Creating Output:
- Confirm you have no unresolved questions that would affect TODO scope or boundaries.
- If uncertain about any aspect, surface it now rather than making assumptions.
- Only proceed to create TODO files when all blocking questions are resolved.

Output:
- Number of TODOs depends on phase complexity:
  - Simple phases: 3–5 TODOs
  - Moderate phases: 5–8 TODOs
  - Complex phases: 8–12+ TODOs (split further if any single TODO exceeds scope)
- Each TODO standalone and executable by an agent
- Keep each TODO concise (2–4 pages max)
- If a TODO grows beyond 4 pages, split it into smaller sub-TODOs
- Store each TODO file in docs/TODO/active/
- Filename pattern: P{phase}_{version}_{short_slug}.md — do NOT include the word "TODO" in the filename.
  - phase: from the overview filename (e.g. P01 → 1, P02.5 → 2.5)
  - version: integer or dotted version (e.g. 01, 02.5, 03.1.2) for sub-TODOs or insertions
  Examples: P1_01_Flutter_Project_Init.md, P1_02_Dependencies.md, P2.5_01_Overlay_Setup.md, P2.5_01.5_Overlay_Styles.md
- TODO numbers must reflect intended implementation order (01 before 02, 01.5 between 01 and 02, etc.)

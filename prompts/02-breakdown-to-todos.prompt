You are given a high-level feature overview @HighLevelTemplate

Your task:
- Decompose this overview into multiple focused TODOs.
- Each TODO must use the provided @02-agent-first-todo.template
- Each TODO should solve one coherent problem.
- Do NOT repeat the entire overview in each TODO.
- Preserve all core invariants and constraints from the overview.
- Surface design decisions and tradeoffs explicitly.
- Assume Context7 will be used for framework and library details.
- If any open questions do not create document yet and let's resolve together. Give at leat 3 of your suggestions with short explanation why, for each of the questions  

Output:
- 3–5 TODOs
- Each TODO standalone and executable by an agent
- Keep each TODO concise (2–4 pages max)
- Store each TODO file in docs/TODO/active/
- Filename pattern: P{phase}_{number:2d}_{short_slug}.md — do NOT include the word "TODO" in the filename.
  Examples: P1_01_Flutter_Project_Init.md, P1_02_Dependencies_And_Analysis.md (not P1_TODO_01_...).
  Use phase from the overview (e.g. Phase 1 → P1); number each TODO 01, 02, … within that phase.

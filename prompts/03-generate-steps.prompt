Decompose this TODO @AgentFirstTODO into ordered execution steps suitable for step-by-step implementation with manual testing between steps.

Output:
- One markdown file per step under docs/TODO/active/steps/
- Filename pattern: P{phase}_{todo}.{step}_{short_slug}.md — do NOT include the word "TODO" in the filename.
  - phase: from the TODO filename (may be versioned, e.g. 1, 2.5)
  - todo: from the TODO filename (may be versioned, e.g. 01, 01.5)
  - step: integer or dotted version (e.g. 01, 02.5, 03.1.2) for sub-steps or insertions
  Derive phase and todo from the Agent-First TODO filename (e.g. P2.5_01.5_Overlay_Styles.md → phase 2.5, todo 01.5).
  Example step filenames: P1_01.01_environment_verification.md, P1_01.02_flutter_create.md, P2.5_01.5.01_overlay_base.md, P2.5_01.5.01.5_overlay_animation.md
- Each step file must contain:
  1. Step number and title
  2. Goal (what this step achieves)
  3. Depends on: (step number or "none")
  4. Concrete tasks (bullet list)
  5. "How to verify" (commands or checks to run; must be runnable; run linter checks only for affected files)
  6. Estimated duration (target ~1 hour or less per step)

## GUI vs Backend Step Decomposition

GUI code (components, widgets, layouts, animations) causes compound bugs when decomposed atomically.

**Backend (atomic):** Data models, services, utilities, pure logic — decompose normally, ~1 hour each.

**Simple GUI (atomic):** Single components, buttons, text fields, simple screens — decompose normally. If the project has a `gui-patterns.json` config, the runner auto-detects GUI steps from path patterns and uses a capable model (via `--GUI_model` if specified, otherwise the `--model` value, or the auto-detected recommendation).

**Compound GUI:** Multiple UI components that compose visually — group into single step with `_GUI_` prefix, ~2-3 hours.

### Naming Convention
- Backend: `P{phase}_{todo}.{step}_{description}.md`
- Simple GUI: `P{phase}_{todo}.{step}_{description}.md` (auto-detected from paths when `gui-patterns.json` is configured)
- Compound GUI: `P{phase}_{todo}.{step}_GUI_{description}.md` (explicit, always works)

### When to Use `_GUI_` Prefix (Compound Steps)
- 3+ UI components that must work together visually
- Components share animation state or layout constraints
- TODO's §5 (Architecture) shows a component hierarchy
- Integration requires visual verification

Simple GUI (single button, single text field, single screen) does NOT need `_GUI_` prefix — the runner detects it from paths when configured.

### GUI Compound Step Structure
Include all related UI components as sections (A, B, C...) within one file, with a final Integration section. Add "## Execution Note" stating this is a compound step to be implemented in a single session. Estimated duration: 2-3 hours.

## General Rules

- Each step must be independently testable.
- Every step MUST include automated test verification in "How to verify":
  - Logic changes: unit or integration tests.
  - UI changes: component/widget tests (e.g., Testing Library, Flutter widget tests, or equivalent for the stack).
  - API or endpoint changes: integration or e2e tests.
- "How to verify" must specify the exact test command to run.
- Manual or visual-only verification is NOT acceptable when automated testing is possible for the stack.
- Tests must mock or explicitly close any I/O used by the code under test (DB, queues, HTTP servers, timers) so the test runner exits cleanly.
- If the TODO involves database changes, never include a step that requests a full DB reset; use additive migrations only.
- Do NOT write any code yet.
- Do NOT repeat the full design from the TODO; reference it by section (e.g. "per §5 Architectural Approach").
- Do NOT include instructions to move files in any step — the runner handles moving step files and TODOs to completed automatically.
- Do not commit to git.
- Step numbers must reflect intended implementation order (01 before 02, etc.).
- GUI triggers before functionality: when implementing UI features (modals, screens, panels), always implement the button/trigger that opens the feature BEFORE implementing the feature itself. This enables manual testing of the UI flow at each step. Example: a "Select Course" button step should precede the course selector modal step.

Before Creating Step Files:
- Confirm you have no unresolved questions that would affect step scope, order, or verification.
- If the TODO has open questions in §11, resolve them first or surface them now.
- If uncertain about any aspect, surface it now rather than making assumptions.
- Only proceed to create step files when all blocking questions are resolved.

Create only the step files. No summary document unless the TODO explicitly asks for one.

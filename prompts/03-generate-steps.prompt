Decompose this TODO @AgentFirstTODO into ordered execution steps suitable for step-by-step implementation with manual testing between steps.

Output:
- One markdown file per step under docs/TODO/active/steps/
- Filename pattern: P{phase}_{todo}.{step}_{short_slug}.md — do NOT include the word "TODO" in the filename.
  - phase: from the TODO filename (may be versioned, e.g. 1, 2.5)
  - todo: from the TODO filename (may be versioned, e.g. 01, 01.5)
  - step: integer or dotted version (e.g. 01, 02.5, 03.1.2) for sub-steps or insertions
  Derive phase and todo from the Agent-First TODO filename (e.g. P2.5_01.5_Overlay_Styles.md → phase 2.5, todo 01.5).
  Example step filenames: P1_01.01_environment_verification.md, P1_01.02_flutter_create.md, P2.5_01.5.01_overlay_base.md, P2.5_01.5.01.5_overlay_animation.md
- Each step file must contain:
  1. Step number and title
  2. Goal (what this step achieves)
  3. Depends on: (step number or "none")
  4. Concrete tasks (bullet list)
  5. "How to verify" (commands or checks to run; must be runnable; run linter checks only for affected files)
  6. Estimated duration (target ~1 hour or less per step)

Rules:
- Each step must be independently testable.
- Every step MUST include automated test verification in "How to verify":
  - Logic changes: unit or integration tests.
  - UI changes: component/widget tests (e.g., Testing Library, Flutter widget tests, or equivalent for the stack).
  - API or endpoint changes: integration or e2e tests.
- "How to verify" must specify the exact test command to run.
- Manual or visual-only verification is NOT acceptable when automated testing is possible for the stack.
- Tests must mock or explicitly close any I/O used by the code under test (DB, queues, HTTP servers, timers) so the test runner exits cleanly.
- If the TODO involves database changes, never include a step that requests a full DB reset; use additive migrations only.
- Do NOT write any code yet.
- Do NOT repeat the full design from the TODO; reference it by section (e.g. "per §5 Architectural Approach").
- Do NOT include instructions to move files in any step — the runner handles moving step files and TODOs to completed automatically.
- If there are open questions that block decomposition, list them and stop; do not create step files until resolved.
- Do not commit to git.
- Step numbers must reflect intended implementation order (01 before 02, etc.).
- GUI triggers before functionality: when implementing UI features (modals, screens, panels), always implement the button/trigger that opens the feature BEFORE implementing the feature itself. This enables manual testing of the UI flow at each step. Example: a "Select Course" button step should precede the course selector modal step.

Create only the step files. No summary document unless the TODO explicitly asks for one.

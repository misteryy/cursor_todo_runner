Decompose this TODO @AgentFirstTODO into ordered execution steps suitable for step-by-step implementation with manual testing between steps.

Output:
- One markdown file per step under docs/TODO/active/steps/
- Filename pattern: P{phase}_{todo}.{step:2d}_{short_slug}.md — do NOT include the word "TODO" in the filename.
  Derive phase and todo from the Agent-First TODO filename (e.g. P1_TODO_01_Flutter_Project_Init.md → phase 1, todo 01).
  Example step filenames: P1_01.01_environment_verification.md, P1_01.02_flutter_create.md (not P1_TODO_01.01_...).
- Each step file must contain:
  1. Step number and title
  2. Goal (what this step achieves)
  3. Depends on: (step number or "none")
  4. Concrete tasks (bullet list)
  5. "How to verify" (commands or checks to run; must be runnable; run linter checks only for affected files)
  6. Estimated duration (target ~1 hour or less per step)

Rules:
- Each step must be independently testable.
- Tests must mock or explicitly close any I/O used by the code under test (Redis, DB, BullMQ, HTTP servers, timers) so Jest exits with no open handles.
- If the TODO involves database changes, never include a step that requests a full DB reset; use additive migrations only.
- Do NOT write any code yet.
- Do NOT repeat the full design from the TODO; reference it by section (e.g. "per §5 Architectural Approach").
- Do NOT include instructions to move files in any step — the runner handles moving step files and TODOs to completed automatically.
- If there are open questions that block decomposition, list them and stop; do not create step files until resolved.
- Do not commit to git.

Create only the step files. No summary document unless the TODO explicitly asks for one.
